   Ensure that the blueprint files are stored in the archive storage tier.
   <br/>
   Ensure that partner access to the blueprint files is secured and temporary.
   <br/>
   Prevent user passwords or hashes of passwords from being stored in Azure.
   <br/>
   Use unmanaged standard storage for the hard disks of the virtual machines.
   <br/>
   Ensure that when users join devices to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), the users use a mobile phone to verify their identity.
   <br/>
   Minimize administrative effort whenever possible.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   User Requirements -
   <br/>

   <br/>
   The Montreal office has 2,000 employees. The Seattle office has 1,000 employees. The New York office has 200 employees.
   <br/>
   All the resources used by Litware are hosted on-premises.
   <br/>
   Litware creates a new Azure subscription. The Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant uses a domain named litware.onmicrosoft.com. The tenant uses the
   <br/>
   Premium P1 pricing tier.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Existing Environment -
   <br/>
   The network contains an Active Directory forest named litware.com. All domain controllers are configured as DNS servers and host the litware.com DNS zone.
   <br/>
   Litware has finance, human resources, sales, research, and information technology departments. Each department has an organizational unit (OU) that contains all the accounts of that respective department. All the user accounts have the department attribute set to their respective department. New users are added frequently.
   <br/>
   Litware.com contains a user named User1.
   <br/>
   All the offices connect by using private connections.
   <br/>
   Litware has data centers in the Montreal and Seattle offices. Each office has a firewall that can be configured as a VPN device.
   <br/>
   All infrastructure servers are virtualized. The virtualization environment contains the servers in the following table.
   <br/>
   <img class="in-exam-image" src="https://examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04081/0046200001.png"/>
   <br/>
   Litware uses two web applications named App1 and App2. Each instance on each web application requires 1 GB of memory.
   <br/>
   The Azure subscription contains the resources in the following table.
   <br/>
   <img class="in-exam-image" src="https://examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04081/0046200002.png"/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   Requirements -
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Planned Changes -
   <br/>
   Litware plans to implement the following changes:
   <br/>
   Deploy Azure ExpressRoute to the Montreal office.
   <br/>
   Migrate the virtual machines hosted on Server1 and Server2 to Azure.
   <br/>
   Synchronize on-premises Active Directory to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
   <br/>
   Migrate App1 and App2 to two Azure web apps named WebApp1 and WebApp2.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Technical Requirements -
   <br/>
   Litware must meet the following technical requirements:
   <br/>
   Ensure that WebApp1 can adjust the number of instances automatically based on the load and can scale up to five instances.
   <br/>
   <img class="in-exam-image" src="https://examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04081/0046200007.png"/>
   <br/>
   Ensure that VM3 can establish outbound connections over TCP port 8080 to the applications servers in the Montreal office.
   <br/>
   Ensure that routing information is exchanged automatically between Azure and the routers in the Montreal office.
   <br/>
   Enable Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for the users in the finance department only.
   <br/>
   Ensure that webapp2.azurewebsites.net can be accessed by using the name app2.litware.com.
   <br/>
   Connect the New York office to VNet1 over the Internet by using an encrypted connection.
   <br/>
   Create a workflow to send an email message when the settings of VM4 are modified.
   <br/>
   Create a custom Azure role named Role1 that is based on the Reader role.

    <br/>
    Connect an on-premises network to a Microsoft Azure virtual network. The VPN gateway includes the following elements:
    <br/>
    ✑ Virtual network gateway. A resource that provides a virtual VPN appliance for the VNet. It is responsible for routing traffic from the on-premises network to the
    <br/>
    VNet.
    <br/>
    ✑ Local network gateway. An abstraction of the on-premises VPN appliance. Network traffic from the cloud application to the on-premises network is routed through this gateway.
    <br/>
    ✑ Connection. The connection has properties that specify the connection type (IPSec) and the key shared with the on-premises VPN appliance to encrypt traffic.
    <br/>
    ✑ Gateway subnet. The virtual network gateway is held in its own subnet, which is subject to various requirements, described in the Recommendations section below.

   <br/>
   All the resources used by Litware are hosted on-premises.
   <br/>
   Litware creates a new Azure subscription. The Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant uses a domain named litware.onmicrosoft.com. The tenant uses the
   <br/>
   Premium P1 pricing tier.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Existing Environment -
   <br/>
   The network contains an Active Directory forest named litware.com. All domain controllers are configured as DNS servers and host the litware.com DNS zone.

   Litware has finance, human resources, sales, research, and information technology departments. Each department has an organizational unit (OU) that contains all the accounts of that respective department. All the user accounts have the department attribute set to their respective department. New users are added frequently.
   <br/>
   Litware.com contains a user named User1.
   <br/>
   All the offices connect by using private connections.
   <br/>
   Litware has data centers in the Montreal and Seattle offices. Each office has a firewall that can be configured as a VPN device.
   <br/>
   All infrastructure servers are virtualized. The virtualization environment contains the servers in the following table.

   <br/>
   The Azure subscription contains the resources in the following table.
   <br/>
   <img class="in-exam-image" src="https://examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04081/0050700002.png"/>

   <br/>
   Enable Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for the users in the finance department only.
   <br/>
   Ensure that webapp2.azurewebsites.net can be accessed by using the name app2.litware.com.

                Upvoting a comment with a selected answer will also increase the vote count towards that answer by one.
                So if you see a comment that you already agree with, you can upvote it instead of posting a new comment.
