    Alerts in Azure Monitor can identify important information in your Log Analytics repository. They are created by alert rules that automatically run log searches at regular intervals, and if results of the log search match particular criteria, then an alert record is created and it can be configured to perform an automated response.
    <br/>
    The Log Analytics agent collects monitoring data from the guest operating system and workloads of virtual machines in Azure, other cloud providers, and on- premises. It collects data into a Log Analytics workspace.

    Alerts in Azure Monitor can identify important information in your Log Analytics repository. They are created by alert rules that automatically run log searches at regular intervals, and if results of the log search match particular criteria, then an alert record is created and it can be configured to perform an automated response.
    <br/>
    The Log Analytics agent collects monitoring data from the guest operating system and workloads of virtual machines in Azure, other cloud providers, and on- premises. It collects data into a Log Analytics workspace.

   You have an Azure subscription that contains the following resources:
   <br/>
    A virtual network that has a subnet named Subnet1
   <br/>
    Two network security groups (NSGs) named NSG-VM1 and NSG-Subnet1
   <br/>
    A virtual machine named VM1 that has the required Windows Server configurations to allow Remote Desktop connections
   <br/>
   NSG-Subnet1 has the default inbound security rules only.
   <br/>
   NSG-VM1 has the default inbound security rules and the following custom inbound security rule:
   <br/>
    Priority: 100
   <br/>
    Source: Any
   <br/>
    Source port range: *
   <br/>
    Destination: *
   <br/>
    Destination port range: 3389
   <br/>
    Protocol: UDP
   <br/>
    Action: Allow
   <br/>
   VM1 has a public IP address and is connected to Subnet1. NSG-VM1 is associated to the network interface of VM1. NSG-Subnet1 is associated to Subnet1.
   <br/>
   You need to be able to establish Remote Desktop connections from the internet to VM1.
   <br/>
   Solution: You add an inbound security rule to NSG-Subnet1 that allows connections from the Any source to the *destination for port range 3389 and uses the TCP protocol. You remove NSG-VM1 from the network interface of VM1.

    Instead export the client certificate from Computer1 and install the certificate on Computer2.

    Note:
    <br/>
    Each client computer that connects to a VNet using Point-to-Site must have a client certificate installed. You generate a client certificate from the self-signed root certificate, and then export and install the client certificate. If the client certificate is not installed, authentication fails.

   You have an Azure subscription that contains 10 virtual networks. The virtual networks are hosted in separate resource groups.
   <br/>
   Another administrator plans to create several network security groups (NSGs) in the subscription.
   <br/>
   You need to ensure that when an NSG is created, it automatically blocks TCP port 8080 between the virtual networks.
   <br/>
   Solution: You create a resource lock, and then you assign the lock to the subscription.

   You have an Azure subscription that contains 10 virtual networks. The virtual networks are hosted in separate resource groups.
   <br/>
   Another administrator plans to create several network security groups (NSGs) in the subscription.

    You should use a policy definition.

   You have an app named App1 that is installed on two Azure virtual machines named VM1 and VM2. Connections to App1 are managed by using an Azure Load
   <br/>
   Balancer.
   <br/>
   The effective network security configurations for VM2 are shown in the following exhibit.
   <br/>
   <img class="in-exam-image" src="https://examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04081/0042100001.jpg"/>
   <br/>
   You discover that connections to App1 from 131.107.100.50 over TCP port 443 fail.
   <br/>
   You verify that the Load Balancer rules are configured correctly.
   <br/>
   You need to ensure that connections to App1 can be established successfully from 131.107.100.50 over TCP port 443.
   <br/>
   Solution: You modify the priority of the Allow_131.107.100.50 inbound security rule.

   You have an Azure subscription that contains 10 virtual networks. The virtual networks are hosted in separate resource groups.
   <br/>
   Another administrator plans to create several network security groups (NSGs) in the subscription.
   <br/>
   You need to ensure that when an NSG is created, it automatically blocks TCP port 8080 between the virtual networks.
   <br/>
   Solution: You assign a built-in policy definition to the subscription.

   You manage a virtual network named VNet1 that is hosted in the West US Azure region.
   <br/>
   VNet1 hosts two virtual machines named VM1 and VM2 that run Windows Server.
   <br/>
   You need to inspect all the network traffic from VM1 to VM2 for a period of three hours.
   <br/>
   Solution: From Performance Monitor, you create a Data Collector Set (DCS).
   <br/>
   Does this meet the goal?

   You have an app named App1 that is installed on two Azure virtual machines named VM1 and VM2. Connections to App1 are managed by using an Azure Load
   <br/>
   Balancer.
   <br/>
   The effective network security configurations for VM2 are shown in the following exhibit.
   <br/>
   <img class="in-exam-image" src="https://examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04081/0044800001.jpg"/>
   <br/>
   You discover that connections to App1 from 131.107.100.50 over TCP port 443 fail.
   <br/>
   You verify that the Load Balancer rules are configured correctly.
   <br/>
   You need to ensure that connections to App1 can be established successfully from 131.107.100.50 over TCP port 443.
   <br/>
   Solution: You create an inbound security rule that denies all traffic from the 131.107.100.50 source and has a priority of 64999.

   You have a computer named Computer1 that has a point-to-site VPN connection to an Azure virtual network named VNet1. The point-to-site connection uses a self-signed certificate.
   <br/>
   From Azure, you download and install the VPN client configuration package on a computer named Computer2.
   <br/>
   You need to ensure that you can establish a point-to-site VPN connection to VNet1 from Computer2.
   <br/>
   Solution: On Computer2, you set the Startup type for the IPSec Policy Agent service to Automatic.

    Each client computer that connects to a VNet using Point-to-Site must have a client certificate installed. You generate a client certificate from the self-signed root certificate, and then export and install the client certificate. If the client certificate is not installed, authentication fails.
