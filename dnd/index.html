    You apply tags to your Azure resources giving metadata to logically organize them into a taxonomy. After you apply tags, you can retrieve all the resources in your subscription with that tag name and value. Each resource or resource group can have a maximum of 15 tag name/value pairs. Tags applied to the resource group are not inherited by the resources in that resource group.
    <br/>
    Box 2: From the Cost analysis blade, filter the view by tag
    <br/>
    After you get your services running, regularly check how much they're costing you. You can see the current spend and burn rate in Azure portal.
    <br/>
    1. Visit the Subscriptions blade in Azure portal and select a subscription.
    <br/>
    You should see the cost breakdown and burn rate in the popup blade.
    <br/>
    2. Click Cost analysis in the list to the left to see the cost breakdown by resource. Wait 24 hours after you add a service for the data to populate.

    Step 1: Install the Azure File Sync agent on Server1
    <br/>
    The Azure File Sync agent is a downloadable package that enables Windows Server to be synced with an Azure file share
    <br/>
    Step 2: Register Server1.
    <br/>
    Register Windows Server with Storage Sync Service
    <br/>
    Registering your Windows Server with a Storage Sync Service establishes a trust relationship between your server (or cluster) and the Storage Sync Service.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Step 3: Add a server endpoint -
    <br/>
    Create a sync group and a cloud endpoint.
    <br/>
    A sync group defines the sync topology for a set of files. Endpoints within a sync group are kept in sync with each other. A sync group must contain one cloud endpoint, which represents an Azure file share and one or more server endpoints. A server endpoint represents a path on registered server.

    Step 1: Upload a configuration to Azure Automation State Configuration.
    <br/>
    Import the configuration into the Automation account.
    <br/>
    Step 2: Compile a configuration into a node configuration.
    <br/>
    A DSC configuration defining that state must be compiled into one or more node configurations (MOF document), and placed on the Automation DSC Pull Server.
    <br/>
    Step 3: Assign the node configuration
    <br/>
    Then: Check the compliance status of the node
    <br/>
    Each time Azure Automation State Configuration performs a consistency check on a managed node, the node sends a status report back to the pull server. You can view these reports on the page for that node.
    <br/>
    On the blade for an individual report, you can see the following status information for the corresponding consistency check:
    <br/>
    The report status ×’â‚¬" whether the node is "Compliant", the configuration "Failed", or the node is "Not Compliant"

    Step 1: Remove peering between Vnet1 and VNet2.
    <br/>
    You can't add address ranges to, or delete address ranges from a virtual network's address space once a virtual network is peered with another virtual network. To add or remove address ranges, delete the peering, add or remove the address ranges, then re-create the peering.
    <br/>
    Step 2: Add the 10.44.0.0/16 address space to VNet1.

    Step 3: Download and run the script to mount a drive on the local computer
    <br/>
    Generate and download script to browse and recover files:
    <br/>
    Step 4: Copy the files using File Explorer!
    <br/>
    After the disks are attached, use Windows File Explorer to browse the new volumes and files. The restore files functionality provides access to all files in a recovery point. Manage the files via File Explorer as you would for normal files.
    <br/>
    Step 1-3 below:
    <br/>
    To restore files or folders from the recovery point, go to the virtual machine and perform the following steps:
    <br/>
    1. Sign in to the Azure portal and in the left pane, select Virtual machines. From the list of virtual machines, select the virtual machine to open that virtual machine's dashboard.
    <br/>
    2. In the virtual machine's menu, select Backup to open the Backup dashboard.
    <br/>
    3. In the Backup dashboard menu, select File Recovery.
